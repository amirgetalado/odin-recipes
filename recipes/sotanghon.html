    <h6>"Refreshing chicken noodle soup also known as chicken sotanghon soup"</h6>

    <p>When introducing this dish to first timers, I call it “Filipino chicken noodle soup”.

        It’s the best explanation. It is literally a soup made up of chicken and noodles.
        
        This chicken sotanghon soup (along with chicken arroz caldo) was a staple in my childhood home during rainy days.
        
        There is something so comforting about this soup.
        
        Using simple ingredients like ginger, garlic, and onion, this sotanghon soup is super flavorful and heart warming.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, peeled and sliced thinly</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced</li>
        <li>1 thumb-size ginger, peeled and julienned</li>
        <li>1 pound chicken wings, tips removed and cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup Chinese celery (kinchay), chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
        <li>7 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon atchuete powder</li>
        <li>1 large carrot, peeled and julienned</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>4 ounces (about 2 coils) sotanghon</li>
        <li>½ head napa cabbage, shredded</li>
        <li>3 hardboiled eggs, peeled and halved</li>
        <li>fried garlic bits</li>
        <li>green onions, chopped</li>
        <li>½ cup oil</li>
        <li>1 head garlic, peeled and minced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot over medium heat, heat oil. Add onions, garlic, and ginger and cook until softened.</li>
        <li>Add chicken and cook, stirring regularly, until lightly browned and juices run clear.
        </li>
        <li>Add celery and cook, stirring regularly, for about 1 to 2 minutes or until softened.</li>
        <li>Add fish sauce and cook for about 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add chicken broth and bring to a boil, skimming any scum that floats on top. Lower heat, cover, and continue to cook until chicken is cooked through.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, combine about ½ cup of the hot broth and atsuete powder. Stir until atsuete is dissolved. Add atsuete water to pot.</li>
        <li>Add carrots and cook for about 1 to 2 minutes or until half-done. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Add sotanghon noodles and push down into broth to soften, stirring gently to separate.</li>
        <li>Ladle soup into bowls and top with boiled eggs, fried garlic bits and green onions. Serve hot.</li>
        <li>When noodles have slightly softened, add cabbage and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes or until noodles are cooked and vegetables are tender yet crisp.</li>
        <li>In a small pan over low heat, heat oil. Add garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 10 to 15 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
        <li>With a slotted spoon, remove from pan and drain on paper towels. Garlic will crisp as it cools.</li>
    </ol>
