    <h6>"Mouth tasting filipino ceviche or known as <i>kilawin</i>"</h6>
    <p>Kinilaw is considered an appetizer much like Latin America’s ceviche or seviche (you can think of it as the Filipino version of ceviche). In fact, there are a lot of ceviche variants from all over the world but this version from the Philippines is something that you must try.<br/>
  Though most would think of this dish as an appetizer, for Filipinos it is more commonly used as a side dish during beer-drinking sessions, referred to as “pulutan“. Its preparation is different too! After all, if most ceviche recipes are normally soaked in citrus juices, kinilaw is rather soaked in vinegar.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>500 grams fresh yellowfin tuna fillet, cut into cubes</li>
    <li>3/4 cup vinegar (for washing)</li>
    <li>1/3 cup vinegar (or spiced vinegar if you have one)</li>
    <li>1 red onion, chopped</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons of ginger, sliced into fine strips or small cubes</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons of Filipino calamansi (you can also use lime or lemon as a substitute)</li>
    <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>3 pieces Thai chili or bird’s eye chili, chopped (optional)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon of sugar (optional)</li>
    <li>1 tomato, diced (optional)</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Prepare all of the ingredients.</li>
    <li>Get a bowl and combine the cubed fish and the 3/4 cup vinegar. Mix them well and let them stand for 2 minutes. Afterward, drain the vinegar while slightly squeezing out the fish cubes.<br/>
        — This ‘washing’ procedure will help reduce the fishy smell.</li>
    <li>Now, combine all the remaining ingredients. Gently toss until all are well blended.</li>
    <li>Cover and place inside the fridge for at least 30 minutes.<br/>
        — It’s fine even if you chill it for more time, but too much might ‘overcook’ the fish. The maximum time I would say is 3 hours!</li>
    <li>Serve chilled. Share and enjoy with a pairing of beer!</li>
  </ol>
